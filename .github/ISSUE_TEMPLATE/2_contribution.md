## Preview

Paste a preview of your icon here. You can generate one using our [preview generator](http://dev.materialdesignicons.com/contribute/github).

## Zip Download

Drag or paste a zip folder containing your icon as a minimal SVG file. We just need the SVG tag with the viewbox and a single path element.
